# LSTM-Model
-Stock Prediction using LSTM model <Br>
-Following are the steps taken to complete the project :<Br>
1. Importing Libraries , Importing data from yahoo.finance <Br>
2. Cleaning data , Removing unwanted columns <Br>
3. Plotting Close/Open price column for visualization <Br>
4. Calculating moving average 100 & 200 and ploting with Close/Open Price <Br>
5. Splitting Close/Open Price data into Training(70%) and Testing(30%) dataset <Br>
6. Then, scaling training dataset and splitting it into x_train , y_train <Br>
7. Forming Model <Br>
8. Now, some of the above steps will be repeat for Testing dataset <Br>
9. Scaling -> Spliting into x_test and y_test <Br>
10. Prediction -> y_pred on the basis of x_test <Br>
11. Atlast, Ploting y_test and y_pred
